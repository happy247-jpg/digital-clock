# Click to Show Clock

This is a simple project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a real-time digital clock that becomes visible when the user clicks a message on the page.

## Features

- Click-to-reveal functionality
- Real-time clock that updates every second
- Clean and minimal user interface
- Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries)

## How It Works

When the page loads, the clock element is hidden. Clicking on the text "Hy I'm a clock ,click me" will make the clock visible. The clock then displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every second using JavaScript's `setInterval()` method.
